Cloud Run

We are using Google Cloud Run to deploy our Machine Learning API because with Cloud Run, we get :

1. Automatic Scalability: Cloud Run automatically scales the number of instances based on demand, from zero to thousands, depending on your needs.

2. Easy Management: You only need to manage your container without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

3. Cost-Effective: You only pay for the resources used while the container is running, reducing costs when the application is not in use.
