These are our utilities to make this application lighter and more efficient to run.

Cloud Run is a managed compute platform that lets you run containers directly on top of Google's scalable infrastructure.

We are using Google Cloud Run to deploy our Machine Learning API because with Cloud Run, we get :

1. Automatic Scalability: Cloud Run automatically scales the number of instances based on demand, from zero to thousands, depending on your needs.

2. Easy Management: You only need to manage your container without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

3. Cost-Effective: You only pay for the resources used while the container is running, reducing costs when the application is not in use.
