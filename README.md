Cloud Run is a managed compute platform that lets you run containers directly on top of Google's scalable infrastructure.

We are using Google Cloud Run to deploy our Machine Learning API because with Cloud Run, we get :

1. Automatic Scalability: Cloud Run automatically scales the number of instances based on demand, from zero to thousands, depending on your needs.

2. Easy Management: You only need to manage your container without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

3. Cost-Effective: You only pay for the resources used while the container is running, reducing costs when the application is not in use.

Cloud Storage is a managed service for storing unstructured data. Store any amount of data and retrieve it as often as you like.

We are using Google Cloud Storage to store our Machine Learning model so that the application can easily access it.

Advantages of Google Cloud Storage
